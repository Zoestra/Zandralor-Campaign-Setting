Genetics expresses itself across generations differently on Zandralor.
When a child is born, choose their species at random from the species present in their *grandparent's* generation.
On very rare occasions, children may be born as a hybrid between two of the species from their grandparent's generation. 
Fraternal twins may be different species, identical twins are always the same species.
fraternal twins of the same species are called "half-identical twins"
If the species of the child is of a size category larger than the species of their parent, they begin life as a child sized appropriately for the parent, and then grow rapidly during their first year to catch up with the expected size for their size category
