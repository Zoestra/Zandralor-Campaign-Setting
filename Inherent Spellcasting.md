Zandralor is a deeply magical setting. all humanoids have some magic. for most people, all they know is 1-4 cantrips, from a list of non-damaging options.
To pick your cantrips, roll a d20 to determine how many cantrips you know, based on this table: 

| Result | # known |
| ------ | ------- |
| 1-10   | 1       |
| 11-16  | 2       |
| 17-19  | 3       |
| 20     | 4       |
then roll a d20 that many times to select your cantrips from this list
