Zandralor is a magical dieselpunk setting embroiled in a globe-spanning war of imperialism, fascism, and revolution. 

# Nations

[[Nations]]




# Languages
There is no "Common" in this setting. each nation has their own languages
however, due to the cultural hegemony of the Jade Empire, hanzi characters have become a near universally recognized writing system. while each language has its own native script, people of the major imperial nations are taught how to read hanzi as though it were their own language, allowing the free exchange of written information. Text written in hanzi by speakers of other languages bears telltale word choice which can identify the language of the author with a DC15 Wisdom(insight) or Intelligence(Investigation) check.

### Creation Myth - Zandra
all cultures share a creation myth, however they have differing details in the stories, and of course put themselves at the center. 
This world was created by a god named Zandra, who also created most of the gods. some of the gods were originally from other worlds, but extended their sway to this end of the material plane. 
Zandralor means "made by Zandra" in an ancient, lost language

this creator god is referred to using they/them pronouns, as the people of this world do not know what gender it held, nor any details about it.

This god is associated with light, and is usually depicted as beams of light breaking through clouds.

Zandra does not have a cult directly associated with them, but they appear in the origin myths of all of the major gods of this world, as the one who created the gods or granted them divinity

mortals who ascend to divinity have their power granted to them by Zandra.

Zandra is viewed as the highest power among the gods, but their influence on the world is said to be unknowable.
