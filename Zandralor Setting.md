# Languages
There is no "Common" in this setting. each nation has their own languages
however, due to the cultural hegemony of the Jade Empire, hanzi characters have become a near universally recognized writing system. while each language has its own native script, people of the major imperial nations are taught how to read hanzi as though it were their own language, allowing the free exchange of written information. Text written in hanzi by speakers of other languages bears telltale word choice which can identify the language of the author with a DC15 Wisdom(insight) or Intelligence(Investigation) check.

### Alternate Language options
If a player does not share a language with their party, they are presented two options for learning a new language: 
- Thick accent
	- the player can speak one shared language with their party, but poorly. they must roleplay having a very limited vocabulary when trying to speak with their party members. 
	- while someone is speaking in a thick accent, players must make a Wisdom(insight) check, DC15 to understand the full content of the message. on a failed check, they only partially understand the message, losing any context or nuance in the statement in the process.
	- when the GM deems appropriate, after the player has roleplayed their thick accent for long enough, they may be granted proficiency in the new language. players are encouraged to continue roleplaying their character with a heavy accent, but it becomes intelligible
- The 13th Warrior
	- the player who chooses this path cannot understand the language in question, and can only communicate with their party members through gestures, written word (hanzi), or other non-speech means.
	- at the GM's discretion, after playing this out for an appropriate period of time, the player can gain full proficiency in that language all at once, out of nowhere. the GM is encouraged to make a scene out of this, and pick a time which is dramatically appropriate, and which will be unexpected to the player.

# History
## Ancient history
zandralor has seen 4 apocalypse events since the advent of humanoid civilization

### The Plasticene Era
The first civilization reached the digital era, and wrecked the planet with global warming caused by fossil fuels.
this era tapped out all the major coal and oil reserves on the planet.
The planet entered runaway global warming, becoming toxic for thousands of years, before entering an Ice Age.

### The Inter-Glacial Era
After the ice age which followed the Plasticene era, civilization rose again, but only reached a medieval level of technology before being wiped out by another ice age


### The Second Impact
The third era was ended by an asteroid impact. not much is known about this era, as the upheaval which followed seems to have erased most evidence of this civilization. This asteroid is what infused the planet with magic, causing traumatic change to the face of the planet

### The Dark Era
The fourth era reached medieval technology and stayed there for several thousand years. it was eventually wiped out due to the actions of evil magic users.

### The Modern era
