Once cast, the target must a Constitution saving throw. On a failure, their body will be covered in bright white light as they are transformed into a sex of the casters choosing. This body can be male, female or intersex. The target is aware of how they will change and can choose to fail the saving throw. The creature is aware of how they will change before they make this decision. The target's clothes and equipment will morph to fit their new body. 

If the target does not have a biological sex, this spell will either cause them to gain a biological sex, or change their species to one which has biological sex. If adding biological sex does not make sense for their species, they become a member of a similar species which does have a biological sex. The species is chosen by the GM, based on similarity to their original species, plane of origin, and so on. If no options seem appropriate, choose a species which can have the same color skin as their former species. The target's former species traits are lost, and replaced with those of the new species, but their species stat bonuses remain the same. 

on a successful cast, the target receives 2 levels of exhaustion. 

_**At Higher Levels.**_ When you cast this using a spell slot of 6th level or higher, the number of targets for the spell increases by 1 for each spell level above 4th.

_**Ritual.**_ If cast as a ritual, the effects will be permanent instead, even if the target was unwilling. The target's new gender and species becomes their "original form" for the purpose of spells such as Alter Self or Polymorph. The effect of this spell cannot be dispelled by Dispel Magic. The only way to undo the effects of this spell are through a *Wish* or a *True Polymorph*.
The transformation is not considered to be an ongoing spell effect, and cannot be detected using Detect Magic, or other similar means.

Changing another creature's gender without its consent is an evil act. Once the ritual is complete, a bright aura of light will surround the target, making the target impossible to see. The aura of light will go away after one minute. Once the light recedes, the transformation is complete. The target's clothes and equipment will morph to fit their new body.
