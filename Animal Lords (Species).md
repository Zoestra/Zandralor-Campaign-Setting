The Animal Folk  
A Pointy Hat Species

“We think of guardian angels as the purview of people, but nothing could be further from the truth. Beasts have their own celestial defenders as well, and the lords of animals are perhaps even more zealous in their protection than those that watch over people. So zealous are they in their guardianship that they are not above requesting help to keep their charges safe. But the will of man is fickle and changing, and so the lords of beasts created people of their own to assist them in their stewardship. That is how the animal folk were born.

“The lords realized that it was often people, not nature, that endangered the existence of those they were sworn to protect, and so they made people of their own to advocate for their brethren and to rise up to defend them. The animal folk are people like any other: they create societies, enclaves, and civilizations, but ones tailored to the needs of folk and beast alike. They are free to lead their lives however they desire, except for the ingrained duty to protect their beastly brethren. This impulse supersedes every other want or need. Able to shapeshift and blend in to both the worlds of man and beast, the animal folk are the eyes and ears, but also the hand, of the animal lords in the mortal planes.

“Just like no two animal lords are the same, no two animal folk are alike, although patterns do emerge. Beekin and Antkin build impossibly large structures, raising their children communally in a bustling hive that rivals the grandest cities of man. The ever-moving, migratory whalekin are often storytellers, sharing what they learn of their travels through song. And the gentle and strong aurochkin often find themselves as wealthy merchants and traders, carrying their stores upon their backs. As busy as any member of the animal folk might be with their own goals and dreams, they’ll never be too busy to turn a helping hand to their bestial siblings. This is the covenant between them and their lords.”

Animal Folk Traits:

Creature Type: Humanoid

Size: Medium (about 5-7 feet tall) or Small (about 2-3 feet tall), chosen when you select this species

Speed: 30 feet

As an Animal Folk, you have these special traits.

Animal Kin. As an anthropomorphic animal, you share the inherent characteristics of the animal whose kin you are. You have 6 Beast Points to spend on your Beast Traits. The cost of each trait is shown on the Beast Traits table.

|   |   |   |
|---|---|---|
|Beast Trait|Description|Beast Point Cost|
|Animal Strike|When you make an Unarmed Strike, you deal Piercing or Slashing (chosen when you select this species) damage equal to 1d6 plus your Strength modifier, instead of the normal damage of an Unarmed Strike.|2|
|Amphibious|You can breathe air and water.|1|
|Blindsight|You have Blindsight with a range of 60 feet.|3|
|Burrow|You have a Burrow Speed equal to half of your Speed.|2|
|Camouflage|After remaining completely motionless for at least one turn, you gain Advantage on your next Dexterity (Stealth) check.|2|
|Climb|You have a Climb Speed equal to your Speed.|2|
|Darkvision|You have Darkvision with a range of 60 feet.|1|
|Flight|You have a Fly Speed equal to your Speed.|4|
|Glide|When you fall at least 10 feet above the ground, you can use your Reaction to glide horizontally a number of feet equal to your Speed, and you take 0 damage from the fall. You determine the direction of the glide.|3|
|Keen Hearing|You have Advantage on Wisdom (Perception) checks that rely on hearing.|2|
|Keen Sight|You have Advantage on Wisdom (Perception) checks that rely on sight.|3|
|Keen Smell|You have Advantage on Wisdom (Perception) checks that rely on smell.|1|
|Natural Armor|You have a base AC of 17 (your Dexterity modifier doesn’t affect this number). You can’t wear Light, Medium, or Heavy armor, but you can wield a Shield as normal.|3|
|Nimble|You have a Speed of 40 feet.|3|
|Powerful Build|You count as one size larger when determining your Carrying Capacity and the weight you can push, drag, or lift.|2|
|Mimicry|You can mimic the sounds of other creatures, including speech. A creature that hears the mimicry must succeed on a Wisdom (Insight) check to determine the effect is faked (DC 8 plus your Charisma modifier and Proficiency Bonus).|1|
|Swim|You have a Swim Speed equal to your Speed.|2|

Once you’ve chosen your Beast Traits, you can choose the animal that best fits that specific combination. For example, if you are a member of the whalefolk, you could choose the Beast Traits Amphibious, Darkvision, Swim, and Powerful Build to represent your chosen animal; choosing Keen Smell, Keen Hearing, and Nimble could mean you take the form of a foxfolk; or you could choose Burrow, Darkvision, Keen Smell, and Powerful Build if you wish to be an antkin.

TIP: In a fantasy world, “mundane” animals can be as different from ours as you and your GM want them to be. Maybe in this world there is a species of octopus that can walk on land with as much dexterity as it can swim in water, and can not only mimic the textures and colors that surround it but also the sounds it hears, leading you to pick Amphibious, Camouflage, Mimicry, and Swim as your Beast Traits. Talk to your GM to come up with interesting options to accommodate your idea of the beast you embody that works for everyone at the table.

Shape-Shifter. Just like the lords that created you, you too can take an Action shift between your regular anthropomorphic form to one of two other forms:

- Animal Form: You shape-shift into the form of the beast you are connected to. Your creature type is now Beast, and your size is either Small, Medium, or Large, depending on the animal chosen. While in this form, you are indistinguishable from a normal beast even through magical means and you can communicate with similar beasts as if you shared a language, but you are unable to use tools, weapons, or armor designed for humanoids.
- Humanoid Form: Your form resembles that of a Human, a Dwarf, an Elf, a Halfling, or a Gnome, chosen when you select this species. Your size is either Small or Medium, depending on the species you resemble. While in this form, you are indistinguishable from the species you resemble even through magical means. You can use tools, weapons, and armor designed for humanoids, but you enjoy none of the benefits you gain from your Animal Kin trait.

None of your game statistics change regardless of your form. Your equipment merges with your Animal Form or is worn by your Humanoid Form. You stay in that form for one hour or until you have the Incapacitated condition, or die. You can also leave the form early as a Bonus Action. Once you use this trait, you can’t use it again until you finish a Long Rest.
