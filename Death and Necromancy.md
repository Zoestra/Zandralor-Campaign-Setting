Coming back from the dead is a difficult task in Zandralor. Crossing through the veil leaves you permanently changed for the worse.

When an individual is brought back from the dead through the effect of a Revivify, Raise Dead, Resurrection, True Resurrection, or Wish spell, they suffer the following effects:
- they receive 4 levels of exhaustion.
	- until those 4 levels of exhaustion are removed, they also suffer the following
		- cannot regain mana through the use of hit dice
		- -1 penalty to all ability scores
		- all magical healing received is reduced by half.
-  they also suffer the following effects permanently
	- -1 penalty to all ability scores (in addition to the penalty from the exhaustion)
	- their pool of hit dice are permanently reduced by 50% (round down)
	- they gain the Undead type in addition to their other types, and are treated as Undead for all purposes, including Turn Undead
	- they gain some number of dark personality traits, as deemed appropriate by the player and the GM
	- They are haunted by the memory of the afterlife they saw while dead, and either long to return, or are terrified of returning, depending on the nature of the afterlife in question. the intensity of this, and how it affects the character is determined by the player. 
	- Their physical appearance takes on some visible traits of undeath, as determined by the player.
	- They are no longer able to fully recover from wounds. any wounds will leave permanent visible marks even after the damage is healed.
	- Their remaining lifespan is doubled. they age as normal, however after they surpass the natural life expectancy, they slowly begin rotting.
	- if raised from the dead by a Revivify, Raise Dead, Resurrection, True Resurrection, or Wish spell again, they come back as any undead monster of equivalent CR to their level at time of death. They retain their memories, but become hostile to all living creatures, including their former allies.
