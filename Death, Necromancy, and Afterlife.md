# Death and the Afterlife
When a mortal dies, their soul exits their body and passes through the *Ethereal Plane* on their way to the afterlife. Creatures which can see in to the Ethereal Plane are able to witness the soul exiting the body, floating away, and slowly fading away. 

After passing through the Ethereal Plane, the soul passes through the Astral Plane, and then moves on to the Fugue Plane, where they  enter the City of Judgement to await their fate. After 1 year and 1 day, they are given audience with Jergal, wherein their name is written into *The Book of the Dead*. Their fate is then determined by whether they are one of *The False*, *The Faithful*, or *The Faithless*


- The False
	- The False are souls which had a god, whom they intentionally betrayed
	- once their name is written in the book of the dead, they are delivered to their god for punishment, which varies from god to god.
	- Gods which have no punishment built into their religion leave the punishment to Jergal. The punishment varies depending on the severity of the crime. The punishment could be anything from escorting visitors to the City of Judgment, to unspeakable tortures, or banishment to the nine hells
	
- The Faithful
	- The Faithful are souls which followed a god, and remained faithful to that god
	- If the god has their own method of judgement, they are delivered to their god for judgement
	- If the god has no method of judgement, they are judged by Jergal, who puts their heart on a scale and compares its weight to that of a feather. if they are pure, they are delivered to their God to enjoy their afterlife. otherwise, they are punished by Jergal. The punishment can range from temporary to eternal. The punished may be forced to atone for their sins within the City of Judgement, or in the Nine Hells. If their punishment is temporary, upon its completion, they are deemed worthy by Jergal
	- Once a soul has been deemed worthy by Jergal, they are given a choice between the following options
		- Deliverance: The soul is delivered to their god, to enter their afterlife
		- Oblivion: Their soul is destroyed permanently, and cannot be restored by any means.
		- Reincarnation: Lac'Nang of the Way of the Unbroken Chain accepts converts after death. More information can be found in the main article on the [[Way of the Unbroken Chain]]
		
- The Faithless
	- The Faithless are souls which followed no god during their life. 
	- Once their name has been written in the Book of the Dead, the faithless are given a choice
		- Purgatory: The faithless remains in the City of Judgement for eternity. Should they choose this, they may at a later time choose to take one of the other two options
		- Oblivion: The soul of the Faithless is destroyed permanently, and cannot be restored by any means.
		- Reincarnation: Lac'Nang of the Way of the Unbroken Chain accepts converts after death. More information can be found in the main article on the [[Way of the Unbroken Chain]]
	
The Fugue Plane is outside of time, meaning the souls of the dead do not experience the time they spend in the afterlife at the same rate as the plane which they originate from. If they are brought back from the Fugue plane by means of necromancy or resurrection, they return after judgement has been passed, their choices have been made, and they experience entering the afterlife they are chosen for. 
- If they are deemed unworthy and assigned a temporary punishment, they experience being brought back to the mortal plane after briefly experiencing their punishment
- If they are deemed unworthy and assigned an eternal punishment, either by their god or by Jergal, or if their soul was bound to the nine hells for some other reason, they experience being brought back to the mortal plane after 1000 years of suffering.


# Resurrection
> "Oh you poor thing....they snatched you away from paradise."

For reasons unknown to either mortals or the gods, the barrier between the outer planes of the Afterlife, and the Prime Material Plane are unusually thick around Zandralor. This causes issues for those attempting to return to life after death.

When an individual is brought back from the dead through the effect of a Revivify, Raise Dead, or Resurrection spell, they suffer the following effects:
- Temporary Effects
	- they receive 4 levels of exhaustion.
		- until those 4 levels of exhaustion are removed, they also suffer the following
			- cannot regain mana through the use of hit dice
			- -1 penalty to all ability scores
			- all magical healing received is reduced by half.
-  Permanent Effects
	- -1 penalty to all ability scores (in addition to the penalty from the exhaustion)
	- their pool of hit dice are permanently reduced by 50% (round down)
	- they gain the Undead type in addition to their other types 
		- they are treated as Undead for the purpose of spells which detect Undead, such as Detect Good and Evil
		- they are treated as Undead for the purpose of Turn Undead
		- they no longer need to eat, drink, or breathe, but their organs continue to function as normal
		- they no longer have the inherent connection to their body which the living normally have. they experience their body as a thing which they inhabit, like a ghost wearing a meat suit. Breathing requires conscious effort, and sensations feel disconnected. 
	- they gain some number of dark personality traits, as deemed appropriate by the player and the GM
	- They remember their time in the afterlife. How this affects the character is determined by the player. 
	- Their physical appearance takes on some visible traits of undeath, as determined by the player.
	- They are no longer able to fully recover from wounds. any wounds will leave permanent visible marks even after the damage is healed.
	- Their remaining lifespan is doubled. they age as normal, however after they surpass the natural life expectancy, they slowly begin rotting.
	- if the individual dies again, and is again raised from the dead by a Revivify, Raise Dead, or Resurrection spell again, they come back as any undead monster of equivalent CR to their level at time of death. They retain their memories and allegiances, but over the course of the following week, their good memories fade, leaving only memories of pain and suffering. During this process, they gradually become hostile to their former allies.

- True Resurrection and Wish
	- The first time an individual is raised using a True Resurrection, or a Wish spell, they suffer only the temporary effects listed above
	- If an individual is resurrected for a second time using the True Resurrection, Wish, or any other resurrection spell, they suffer the permanent effects as listed above

- Reincarnation
	- If a character is resurrected using the Reincarnation spell, they suffer the following effects
		- They suffer the temporary effects listed above
		- Their soul experiences an encounter with the god Lac'nang where they are told the conditions of their reincarnation
		- They have 1 year and 1 day to find a Temple of the Unbroken Chain, and dedicate themselves to Lac'nang, or they suffer the permanent effects listed above.

When any of these resurrection spells are cast on an individual, they may refuse the resurrection. if they do, their soul appears above their body, or in a space adjacent to the caster, as a ghostly apparition. They may speak freely with the caster and those nearby about their reasoning for the refusal, or any other topic. Once the conversation is concluded, their soul returns to the afterlife. During this time, their soul is bound to their body, or to the location they were summoned in. They cannot move of their own volition, but if their body is moved, they move with it. They may remain in this state for up to a year and a day. This may only occur once, and any subsequent attempts to resurrect the individual result only in the ghostly sound of their voice whispering *"No"*. At any point during that year and a day, if the soul is still lingering, the soul may change their mind and choose to accept the resurrection, even if they are outside of the time limit stipulated by the spell. If the soul is bound to their body, and their body is destroyed, they return to the afterlife, and can no longer become the target of any resurrection spell.

Individuals effected by the permanent effects listed above are commonly known as "*The Resurrected*". 

Determining whether someone is one of the Resurrected requires a DC12 Investigation, Arcana, Nature, or Religion check

Knowledge of the Resurrected is common, requiring only a DC8 Arcana, History, Nature, or Religion check to know of their existence.

The common perception of the Resurrected is not as negative as the common perception of other undead. Most people pity the Resurrected, rather than fear them. 
- The Resurrected have advantage on persuasion checks to ask for charity or mercy, if the target is aware of their Resurrected status.


# Necromancy
When an necromancer raises a corpse from the dead through the effect of the *Animate Dead* spell, or any similar necromantic spell, ability, or effect which requires the corpse of a humanoid as part of its casting, the soul to which that corpse belonged to is violently ripped from the afterlife and bound to the undead which is created by that spell, ability, or effect. Such undead are referred to as "*Soulbound Undead*"

This only effects corpses which have been dead for less than a year and a day. If the corpse used for a necromantic spell, ability, or effect belonged to a soul which died more than a year and a day prior to the casting of this spell, then the undead is raised with no soul attached to it.

The Soulbound Undead retains its memories of life, and the afterlife, however their minds are clouded, and they usually do not understand that they are dead. 
If they are bound to the will of a necromancer, they have no ability to resist their commands.

A Soulbound Undead which becomes untethered from a necromancer regains its will, and may act according to their own desires. Such undead are not automatically hostile to living creatures, but they gain an irresistible hunger for the flesh or spiritual energy of living humanoids. 

When they see a living humanoid, they must pass a DC13 will save, or be overcome with the desire to kill and consume that humanoid. For every minute they spend in the presence of living humanoids, they must make this save again, adding -1 to their cumulative penalty every time they have to make this save. This penalty resets when they consume a humanoid, but they receive a permanent -1 to their Wisdom score each time they consume a humanoid.

Soulbound Undead which are not controlled by necromancers commonly attempt to return to their lives, which inevitably ends in tragedy when they attack their loved ones.
