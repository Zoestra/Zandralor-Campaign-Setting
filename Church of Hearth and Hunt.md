lawful god/goddess of the hunt and the hearth.
The Lord and Lady
strict gender rules, traditional family values.

### Conscription, The Hunt
At the age of 16, all citizens of the countries which worship the Lord and Lady must fulfill mandatory military service. when they enter the military, they have *Change Gender* cast on them, turning them male (if applicable)

### Marriage
at the end of their 4 year mandatory service, any man who does not wish to continue their service is wed to one of their squad mates. The Lady then chooses one of the pair to become female, and *Change Gender* is cast on them. This is referred to as being "Chosen by the Lady"

if two soldiers choose each other, those pairings are honored, otherwise the match is chosen by the Lord and Lady (at random)

should one refuse this marriage, they are exiled from the country. this applies to worshippers of other gods as well, it is a requirement of citizenship in these theocracies.

### Fertility
The couple are expected to produce children within 1 year. if they fail to do so, they are put under supervision by the church, have fertility potions administered to them, and are required to have sex under the supervision of a cleric of the church, to ensure conception.
This practice repeats for the first 5 years of marriage, wherein the couple is expected to produce at least 3 children. Most couples go farther than this however, as having a large family is itself viewed as a form of piety. Childbirth is treated as a religious rite which brings the mother closer to The Lady. 

### Clergy
When a soldier leaves the military, if there are no squad mates to pair them with for marriage, they have 2 choices - continue in the military, or become a member of the clergy.
All members of the clergy have *[[Change Gender]]* cast on them to become intersex (androgynous look, 50% have beards, breasts, dual genitalia).
The ceremonial garb of the clergy of this church are designed to leave their breasts and genitals exposed.

### The Hunt
Nations which follow the Lord and Lady do not engage in traditional animal husbandry. rather than raising animals for slaughter, they manage large wildlife preserves for the purpose of hunting. 
All civilian males are expected to hunt at least once per year as a religious rite.

### Domains
The primary domains of The Lady are Life and Order.
The primary domains of The Lord are War and Nature.

Clerics who are engaged in active military service are expected to practice the War domain, however some choose to practice the Life domain. Those who follow the Life domain are almost always Chosen by The Lady to become mothers after they exit military service. 

When leaving military service, Male clerics are expected to switch to the Nature domain. 
Clerics who are Chosen by The Lady are expected to switch to the Life or Order domains.

This change of domain occurs as part of the marriage ritual.
