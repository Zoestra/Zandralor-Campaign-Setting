# Alternate Language options
If a player does not share a language with their party, they are presented two options for learning a new language: 
- Thick accent
	- the player can speak one shared language with their party, but poorly. they must roleplay having a very limited vocabulary when trying to speak with their party members. 
	- while someone is speaking in a thick accent, players must make a Wisdom(insight) check, DC15 to understand the full content of the message. on a failed check, they only partially understand the message, losing any context or nuance in the statement in the process.
	- when the GM deems appropriate, after the player has roleplayed their thick accent for long enough, they may be granted proficiency in the new language. players are encouraged to continue roleplaying their character with a heavy accent, but it becomes intelligible
- The 13th Warrior
	- the player who chooses this path cannot understand the language in question, and can only communicate with their party members through gestures, written word (hanzi), or other non-speech means.
	- at the GM's discretion, after playing this out for an appropriate period of time, the player can gain full proficiency in that language all at once, out of nowhere. the GM is encouraged to make a scene out of this, and pick a time which is dramatically appropriate, and which will be unexpected to the player.
